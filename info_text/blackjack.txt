1. What is Blackjack?
Blackjack is a fast-paced card game where the goal is to beat the dealer by having a hand value as close to 21 as possible — without going over.
It’s typically played with 1 to 8 decks of 52 cards and is one of the most popular casino games worldwide due to its mix of luck, strategy, and low house edge.

2. How Cards Are Valued
- Number cards (2–10) are worth their face value
- Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10
- Aces are special — they can be worth either 1 or 11, whichever is more favorable for your hand

Example:
- A hand of Ace + 7 = 18 (soft 18)
- A hand of 10 + 8 = 18 (hard 18)

3. Objective and Basic Rules
The main goal is to beat the dealer by:
- Getting a total higher than the dealer’s hand without exceeding 21
- Or, if the dealer busts (goes over 21) and you don’t
If your total goes over 21, you bust and automatically lose, no matter what the dealer has.

4. Player Actions
On your turn, you can:
- Hit: Ask for another card
- Stand: End your turn and keep your hand as is
- Double Down: Double your bet, take one more card, and then stand
- Split: If you have two of the same value (e.g., 8–8), you can split into two separate hands
- Surrender: Forfeit half your bet to fold the hand early (not allowed at all tables)

5. What is a Blackjack?
A “Blackjack” is when your first two cards are an Ace and any 10-point card (10, J, Q, or K). This is the strongest hand and typically pays out 3:2, unless the dealer also has a Blackjack — then it’s a tie.

6. Dealer Rules
- The dealer must hit until their hand totals 17 or higher
- In most games, the dealer stands on all 17s (including “soft” 17 with an Ace), but this can vary by table

7. Outcomes
Here’s how a round can end:
- Win: Your hand is higher than the dealer’s or the dealer busts
- Lose: Your hand busts or is lower than the dealer’s
- Push: Your hand and the dealer’s hand have the same total — you keep your bet, but don’t win extra

8. Basic Tips for Beginners
- Always hit if your total is 11 or less — you can’t bust
- Stand on 17 or more if the dealer shows a weak card (2–6)
- Use a strategy chart to help guide decisions based on your hand and the dealer’s upcard
- Don’t take insurance — it’s usually a losing bet in the long run

9. Why Blackjack Is Unique
Unlike most casino games, Blackjack can be beaten with skill. Players who learn proper strategy — and advanced techniques like card counting — can reduce the house edge or even gain an advantage.
It’s a game of both luck and skill — and one of the few where smart play truly pays off.
